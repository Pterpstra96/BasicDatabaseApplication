This application is a C#, WPF and SQL based database application. 

Its functions are relatively simple and the application is being used by me to develop my skills and understanding of coding concepts. 

It functions by initializing a database through SQL server. The current user is logged in a database entry and called upon. To limit the bloat within SQL server, user tables are save within one database and not distributed to other databases. 

More functions are added and fleshed out as I have time. My longer term focus will be on data entry validation, cleaning up visuals and encryption for user accounts. 


**AI notice - I am deliberately avoiding using CoPilot or other AI tools to assist in this project. While I believe these tools can be useful, I want to solve problems myself at this point without an AI tool solving them for me. I believe this will make me a better programmer in the end. 

Thank you for your time.
